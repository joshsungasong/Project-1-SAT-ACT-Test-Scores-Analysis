# Project-1-SAT-ACT-Test-Scores-Analysis

This project involved looking at a simple dataset for this project that was during the beginning of the program. The dataset consisted of statewide test scores for the SAT and ACT college entrance examinations. I utilized skills such as exploratory data analysis and data cleaning/munging using Python's Pandas, data visualizations to detect patterns in the data and conduct hypothesis tests and confidence intervals to perform statistical inference on the data. It was a nice prelude to what I will be doing for the rest of the program and also as a data scientist. Link here to the project repository.

The main findings of this project:
- The ACT test had higher participation rates than the SAT test based on the data.
- The composite ACT score did not match the total SAT score. Having averages of both tests would have made the analysis more representative.
