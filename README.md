# Project 1: SAT/ACT test data analysis

This project involved looking at a simple dataset for this project that was during the beginning of the program. The dataset consisted of statewide test scores for the SAT and ACT college entrance examinations. I utilized skills such as exploratory data analysis and data cleaning/munging using Python's Pandas, data visualizations to detect patterns in the data and conduct hypothesis tests and confidence intervals to perform statistical inference on the data. It was a nice prelude to what I will be doing for the rest of the program and also as a data scientist. 

The main findings and recommendations of this project:
- The ACT test had higher participation rates than the SAT test based on the data.
- The composite ACT score did not match the total SAT score. Having averages of both tests would have made the analysis more representative.
- Convert the test scores into raw percentages (percent of a perfect score) as the SAT and ACT tests are scored differently
- Collect more granular data as the dataset infers that the test scores of the less populous state such as Connecticut are weighted the same as the test scores of a more populous state such as Texas
- The SAT test has higher participation rates in regions such as the Northeast, but so much in the Midwest. The opposite is true for the ACT test. I would focus increasing participation rates for the SAT test in the Midwest.
